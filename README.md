# EV Car Purchase Prediction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their eco-friendly nature and lower operating costs. However, predicting whether a customer will purchase an EV or not can be challenging as it depends on various factors such as demographics, personal preferences, and financial considerations.

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a customer will buy an electric vehicle or not, based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, we can uncover patterns and relationships that influence a customer's decision-making process.

The primary objective of this project is to build a reliable prediction model that can assist automotive companies, dealerships, and policymakers in understanding customer behavior and making informed decisions. This could include tailoring marketing strategies, optimizing inventory management, or designing targeted incentives to promote EV adoption.
